purse category edit <old-category-name> <new-category-name>
```

To delete a category:

### Development

To run the CLI in development mode with hot reloading:

```bash
bun run dev
```

To run the CLI in production mode:

```bash
bun run start
```

### Building

To build the `purse` binary:

```bash
bun run build
```

### Configuration

The `purse` CLI can load configuration from a YAML file. By default, it looks for a file named `.purse.yml` in your home directory (`~/.purse.yml`).

You can specify a custom configuration file path using the `-c` or `--config` flag:

```bash
purse --config /path/to/your/custom/config.yml <command>
```

Example `~/.purse.yml`:

```yaml
database:
  path: ~/.purse_data.json

display:
  currencySymbol: '‚Ç¨'
  dateFormat: 'fr-FR' # e.g., 'en-US', 'en-GB', 'fr-FR'

categories:
  - Food
  - Transport
  - Salary
  - Rent
  - Utilities
  - Entertainment
```

An example configuration file `example.yml` is provided in the project root for reference.

### Category Management

Categories can be managed via the CLI or interactive mode. Changes are saved to your configuration file.

To add a new category:

```bash
purse category add <category-name>
```

To edit an existing category:

```bash
purse category edit <old-category-name> <new-category-name>
```

To delete a category:

```bash
purse category delete <category-name>
```

### Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
bun test
```
